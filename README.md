# PBKDF2-Python-Builtin
PBKDF2 example from Python's built-in (as of 2.7.8 and 3.4)  hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac implementation, a fast version of which is available with OpenSSL

Works with at least Python 2.7.8 on Linux, and PyInstaller can turn it into a Windows executable.

To run, you'll need to download Python 2.7.8 or higher - you can get this from http://www.python.org/download/ for Windows and MacOS, or with something like "sudo apt-get install python" for Debian Linux.
